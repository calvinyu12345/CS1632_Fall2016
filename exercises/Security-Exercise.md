## Security Exercise

You may work by yourself or with a partner for this exercise.

1. Go to https://hackthissite.org and create a user
2. I will go over the first three basic missions at the beginning of class.
2. You will complete the rest of the basic missions.
3. If you complete all of the basic missions today, email me with a screenshot of the last completed mission by MIDNIGHT TONIGHT along with what the password was, and you will get a prize on Thursday.

### Hints

1. Basic mission #7 - If you don't know basic Unix commands such as `ls`, you may want to read up on them.
2. Basic mission #8 - This mission requires knowledge of server-side includes (SSI).  You may want to review this page: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server-Side_Includes_(SSI)_Injection
3. Basic mission #11 - All of these songs are by the same person, and whoever created the directories underneath this is a big fan.  Also, you may want to freshen up on why some files are hidden on Unix systems.
